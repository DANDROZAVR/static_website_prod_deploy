# static_website_prod_deploy :zap:
This repo contains code snippets and scripts for easy deploy of static website.  
Snippets and scripts is suited for Windows environment.

# What is this? :icecream:

Using these tools you can push your static website code to server only with two commmands - 
`npm run build_prod`
and 
`npm run deploy`

> Why two but not one? Because sometimes there is need of checking builded code before pushing to production. If you do not have this need, > code can be easily modified for only one command to deploy.
